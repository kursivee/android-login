Kotlin Login App

Using ANKO lib to create a test app that takes in user credentails and transitions to next page.

P.S. No idea what I'm doing

Description:

Login screen that takes username and password. Fields are both hideable.

On success, pass user name to welcome screen and display Welcome, ${username}


WTFs?

WTF is with(ui) in the create view functions?
WTF is intent-filter?
WTF is category?
WTF is action?
WTF is an implicit/explicit intent?
